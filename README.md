Enterprise Lab: Active Directory, Windows Server 2022, and Windows 11. Security-focused system administration and troubleshooting.

# Windows Active Directory Home Lab

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment and management of a small-scale enterprise network. I built this lab to simulate real-world IT support scenarios, focusing on user lifecycle management, network connectivity, and system security.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox 7.2.4
* **Server:** Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller, DNS, AD DS)
* **Client:** Windows 11 Pro (Domain-Joined)
* **Networking:** Isolated Internal Virtual Network (172.16.0.0/24)

### 🚀 Key Labs Completed
1. **Active Directory Setup:** Configured a new forest (`HomeLab.local`) and promoted a Windows Server 2022 instance to Domain Controller.
2. **User Management:** Created Organizational Units (OUs) for departments (e.g., Marketing) and managed user accounts using standard naming conventions.
3. **Advanced Troubleshooting:** Resolved a local administrative lockout on a Windows 11 endpoint using the **Utilman Hack** (System file replacement via WinRE), demonstrating deep OS-level troubleshooting skills.
4. **Networking:** Configured static IP addressing and verified DNS resolution between server and client.
